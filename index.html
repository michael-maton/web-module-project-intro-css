        Not just a great valley, but a shrine to human foresight, the strength
        of granite, the power of glaciers, the persistence of life, and the
        tranquility of the High Sierra.
        <br /><br />
        First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known for its
        waterfalls, but within its nearly 1,200 square miles, you can find deep
        valleys, grand meadows, ancient giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area,
        and much more.

        Fire is a natural and essential<br />
        part of Yosemite. We manage fire <br />
        carefully and study how it<br />
        interacts with the park’s<br />
        ecosystems. This blog provides<br />
        updates about fires in Yosemite.<br />
